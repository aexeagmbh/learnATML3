# learnATML3
This is the website for our new interactive ATML3 learning tool.
in it's final shape, it will consist of ipython(Jupyter) notebooks that interact with the myAX and rincewind APIs to render the learner's test input.

Visitors will be able to learn ATML3 in simple, 5-minute lessons and verify their learnings in a controlled and ambiguity-free environment, once this page is finished.
